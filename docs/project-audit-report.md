**Critical Issue UI-001:** Inconsistent hover/focus states across interactive elements.**

## 3. User Flow Validation

### Primary User Journeys

#### Onboarding Flow
**Status:** ❌ Incomplete

**Issues:**
- Some animations missing (coin clicks don't animate consistently)
- Page transitions not optimized for mobile

## 4. UI/UX Design Assessment

### Design System Consistency

| Category | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|

### Dark Mode Support
**Status:** ❌ Not Implemented  
**Impact:** Users on light-sensitive environments affected

## 5. Bug Tracker Entries

### Critical Priority (P0)
1. **VAL-001** Empty task creation blocker
   - **Steps:** 1. Open Tasks 2. Add new task 3. Leave title empty 4. Save
   - **Expected:** Validation error prevent save
   - **Actual:** No validation, empty task created

2. **ACC-001** Missing accessibility features for kids zone
   - **Impact:** Differently-abled children cannot use features
   - **Recommendation:** Add screen reader support, larger touch targets

### Major Priority (P1)
3. **FEAT-001** Task form validation missing
4. **UX-003** Alert abuse in settings navigation
5. **UI-001** Inconsistent interactive states
6. **ERR-001** Incomplete error boundary coverage
7. **FLOW-001** Missing onboarding flow

### Minor Priority (P2)
8. **PERF-001** Missing loading states on API calls
9. **FEAT-002** Hard-coded archetypal balance
10. **UX-002** Unclear reward timing

### Suggestions (P3-P4)
11. Task priority options
12. Memory tagging system
13. Dark mode toggle
14. Data export preferences
15. Push notification controls

## Detailed Component Analysis

### Code Quality Assessment

#### Positive Patterns:
- Proper TypeScript usage throughout
- React hooks implemented correctly
- Component composition clean
- Custom hooks for shared logic (useLiveData, useSocket)

#### Issues Found:
- Some components overly complex (HomeDashboard has 200+ lines)
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Some unused state variables remain

### Technical Debt:
- 5+ major debt items identified
- Maintained codebase (TypeScript, linting in place)
- Some legacy patterns (alert() usage)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Implement comprehensive accessibility features**
2. **Add form validation for user inputs**
3. **Replace alert() calls with proper UI components**
4. **Add loading states for better UX**

### Medium Term
5. **Complete onboarding flow**
6. **Implement comprehensive error boundaries**
7. **Add dark mode support**
8. **Improve testing coverage**

### Long Term
9. **Accessibility compliance audit**
10. **Performance optimization**
11. **Advanced features development**

## Next Steps

1. Review critical issues and assign ownership
2. Create detailed action items with timelines
3. Schedule follow-up audit after fixes
4. Consider user testing for UX improvements
