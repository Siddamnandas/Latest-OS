# GitHub Actions CI/CD Fix Summary

## Problem
GitHub Actions workflow runs were failing with dependency issues, specifically:
- **"@radix-ui/react-toast is missing from dependencies"** error
- `npm ci` failures due to package.json and package-lock.json being out of sync
- Various packages reported as missing from the lock file

## Root Cause
1. **Stale npm cache**: GitHub Actions was using cached npm data that didn't match current dependencies
2. **Missing cache-dependency-path**: The Node.js setup wasn't properly caching based on package-lock.json
3. **Lock file synchronization**: The package-lock.json needed to be regenerated to include all current dependencies

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- **Added `cache-dependency-path: package-lock.json`** to both lint-and-test and build jobs
- **Added npm cache cleaning step** before dependency installation
- **Added verification step** to check package.json and lock file sync before npm ci
- **Improved error handling** by using dry-run verification

### 2. Regenerated package-lock.json
- Removed and regenerated the package-lock.json file to ensure all dependencies are properly resolved
- Verified that @radix-ui/react-toast and other dependencies are correctly included

### 3. Enhanced CI Steps
```yaml
- name: Clear npm cache
  run: npm cache clean --force
- name: Verify package files sync
  run: |
    echo "Checking package.json and package-lock.json sync..."
    npm ci --dry-run
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Expected Results
✅ GitHub Actions workflows should now pass successfully
✅ All dependencies should install correctly via npm ci
✅ No more "missing from dependencies" errors
✅ Improved caching and faster CI runs

## Future Prevention
1. **Always run `npm install` after adding/updating dependencies** to keep lock file in sync
2. **Commit both package.json AND package-lock.json** when making dependency changes
3. **Test locally with `npm ci`** before pushing to ensure CI compatibility
4. **Monitor CI cache behavior** - clear cache if dependency issues persist

## Verification Commands
To verify everything is working locally:
```bash
# Test npm ci works correctly
rm -rf node_modules && npm ci

# Verify specific dependency
npm ls @radix-ui/react-toast

# Test dry-run
npm ci --dry-run
```

## Troubleshooting
If CI fails again with dependency issues:
1. Clear GitHub Actions cache (in repository settings)
2. Re-run the failed workflow
3. Check if new dependencies were added without updating package-lock.json
4. Verify no package.json syntax errors
